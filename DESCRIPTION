Title: An R package for phospho-site localization and motif extraction from phospho-proteomic datasets
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jacob M. Wozniak
Maintainer: Jacob M. Wozniak <jakewozniak@gmail.com>
Description: The R package, PhosPhinder, was designed to facilitate the in-depth analysis of phospho-proteomic data by researchers, even those with little programming background. The package contains three functions: parseDB, phindPhospho and extractBackground. Together, these functions allow users to reformat “.fasta” databases for easier analysis, localize phospho-sites within full proteins, extract motifs surrounding identified phospho-sites and create proteome-specific motif backgrounds for statistical purposes.
